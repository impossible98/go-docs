# Buffered Channels

Channels can be _buffered_. Provide the buffer length as the second argument to `make` to initialize a buffered channel:

```go
ch := make(chan int, 100)
```

Sends to a buffered channel block only when the buffer is full. Receives block when the buffer is empty.

Modify the example to overfill the buffer and see what happens.

## Examples

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	ch := make(chan int, 2)
	ch <- 1
	ch <- 2
	fmt.Println(<-ch)
	fmt.Println(<-ch)
}
```

**Output:**

```
1
2
```
